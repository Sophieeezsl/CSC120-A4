- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I really like this idea! It shows how different classes coorporate together to make program function and this process of managing them is very interesting to me. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Start early on every assignment, even if just opening it and reading through the instructions can help. Those information will be processing in your mind secretely and work out better when you start to code. 

- I am not sure how much fuel I should reduce when the engine works. 

I find this assignment making more sense than the previous one, which could be because I am becoming  more familiar with Java. It can also be because the car is just a more solid object to think of.

I am not sure if some of the methods can be private. I feel like they can be both private and public and it does not really affect the program running.

last edit: I figured out how javadoc header is different from python comments.
